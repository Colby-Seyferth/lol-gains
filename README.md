Use Riot APIs to get stats from recent games

Need to get your own access token from the RIOT developer portal: https://developer.riotgames.com/

Save it by itself in a text file in the same directory as lol_gains.py as "token.txt"


In order to use the APIs, you'll need to install the riotwatcher package: pip install riotwatcher
